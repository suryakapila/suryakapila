# 👋 Hi, I’m @SuryaKapila  

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a **backend-focused software engineer** with experience building full-stack and backend systems, working heavily on **APIs, integrations, databases, and cloud infrastructure**.  

I enjoy building practical systems that are clean, scalable, and production-oriented — and I’m currently doubling down on **backend depth + infra engineering**.

---

## 🌱 What I’m currently working on  
- 🧱 Building backend-first projects using **Typescript + Nodejs + Nestjs**  
- 🔁 Designing reliable systems: queues, retries, idempotency, and message delivery guarantees  
- ☁️ Strengthening infrastructure skills using **RabbitMQ + Docker + AWS fundamentals**  
- 🧠 Practicing **system design + low-level design** consistently  

---

## 🛠 Tech I’ve worked with  
- **Languages:** Java, JavaScript (ES6+), C#, Python  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (learning/building), Node.js, Express.js , Nest.js, Django, FastAPI, React.js
- **Databases:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL  
- **Infra/Cloud:** AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda), Docker  
- **Integration:** REST, SOAP, SMTP, XML, XSLT  
- **Tools:** Git  

---

## 📌 What I’m optimizing for  
- Backend engineering excellence  
- Infrastructure + cloud fundamentals  
- Strong system design intuition  
- Writing production-quality code (not just demos)
